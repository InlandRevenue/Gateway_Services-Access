# Intermediation Service

Intermediation is the process of linking a business intermediary (such as a tax agent, 
bookkeeper, payroll bureau, payroll intermediary etc) to an individual or organisation 
so the intermediary can act on their behalf for tax purposes. 

The Intermediation Gateway Service provides the ability for intermediaries to:
- manage links to clients (link, delink and update) 
- retrieve clients and client lists that are already established.
